## Setup & Development

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
# or
npm install
```

### 2. Run the frontend

```bash
cd client
bun run dev
# or
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:5173
```

### 3. Build & deploy the Move smart contract

```bash
cd VideoPlatform
sui move build
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
# Save the packageId and objectId for frontend configuration
```

### 4. Environment configuration (if needed)

Create a `.env` file in `client/` with:
```
VITE_SUI_PACKAGE_ID=0x...         # packageId after deployment
VITE_VIDEO_LIST_ID=0x...          # objectId of VideoList
```

## Server (server.js) [English]

- **server.js** is a lightweight Express server that acts as a proxy to upload videos from the frontend to the decentralized storage service Walrus (IPFS/Tusky).
- When a user uploads a video, the file is sent to the `/api/upload` endpoint of this server, which then forwards the file to Walrus via its API, receives the storage link (CID/hash), and returns it to the frontend.
- This server helps secure your API key and simplifies the process of uploading large files from the browser.
- You can configure CORS, API key, and vaultId directly in the `server.js` file.

### Frontend (client)

- **Home Page**: Displays videos, shorts, filters, creator spotlights, and upload section.
- **Shorts**: Watch short videos, navigate with arrow keys, tip, follow creators.
- **Creator Dashboard**: View analytics (views, earnings, subscribers), upload new videos, manage content.
- **Upload Section**: Upload form for video title, description, file, type (short/long), uploads to walrus, sends add_video transaction to Sui.
- **Sui Wallet Integration**: Connect wallet, send add_video, tip, claim_reward transactions via `@mysten/dapp-kit`.

### Smart Contract (VideoPlatform)

- **Structs**:
  - `VideoList`: List of videos, id_counter, vector<Video>
  - `Video`: id, title, desc, cid, owner, is_short, tips, rewarded
- **Main Functions**:
  - `init_video_list`: Initialize the VideoList object
  - `add_video`: Add a new video
  - `tip`: Tip SUI to the creator
  - `claim_reward`: Reward viewers (each viewer can claim once per video)
  - `video_count`, `get_video`: Data retrieval for frontend

---

## Blockchain & Storage Integration

- **Video Storage**: Upload files to walrus (IPFS/Tusky), receive a CID/hash, store the CID on-chain.
- **Blockchain Transactions**: Send add_video, tip, claim_reward transactions via Sui wallet (dapp-kit).
- **Data Retrieval**: Frontend calls smart contract functions to fetch video lists, video info, tips, and rewards.
